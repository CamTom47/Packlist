| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.

| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                       

This will be a mobile application. The intention of this is to provide a quick checklist of items needed for backpacking tripping so it makes more sense if this is easily accessible on a mobile device that you can carry around with you as you collect items and udpate the checklist.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         |
| Goal       | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?        

The goal of this is to provide a user with a complete checklist of items needed for their back packing trip. The items would include essential and non-essential items.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                      

The target user for this application would be outdoor enthusiasts going on a backpacking trip.

                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. |

I would like to find an API that has outdoor trail information, but from what I can tell the most popular API for this has been made private, so I may need to use a scraper API to get trail information needed. If I cannot find this data, I plan to utiize weather data, air quality data, location data, in combination to manual entry data from the user.
