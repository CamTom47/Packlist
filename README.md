## Application Description
Packlist at its core is a backpacking preparation app. The goal of the application is to create a comprehsive, customizable list of backpacking items and equipment, tailored to the preferences of the user and the environment/conditions of their trips. 

## Features
 - Users can create *packs* of items and gear to be used on their backpacking trips. These items are composed of pre-defined defaults as well as ones created by the users themselves.
 - Users can create *trips* that store basic information about upcoming trips, including names, mileage, locations, etc.
 - Users can check that their pack has all of the recommended items for their upcoming trip. Packlist will provide a dynamic list of recommended items for a trip based on upcoming trip conditions/temperature/environment.
 - Once a trip is completed, a user can see their trip stats on the profile dashboard.

## User Flow

- (Optional) A user can create personal items to add to their packs.

- A user checks their pack against the trip it is assigned to and adjusts their pack based if desired
- Now that the pack is complete, a user can user the pack as a checklist when preparing for their upcoming trip
